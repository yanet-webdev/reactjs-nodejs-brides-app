But, if you give yourself\n            enough time to plan and sort the tasks month by month with a\n            wedding-planning checklist and wedding timeline, the job becomes\n            more fun and less stressful.\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"subtext\">\n            Though 12 to 14 months is the ideal length for an engagement, every\n            couple’s engagement time is different. (Brand once planned a wedding\n            for a couple in a mere seven weeks.) If your engagement length is\n            shorter, Brand’s advice is to condense the schedule. “If you’re\n            getting married in six months, try to complete all the\n            wedding-planning checklist tasks designated for month 12 to 6 in\n            that very first month, and then you’ll be right on schedule with\n            everything else,” she says.\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"subtext\">\n            Brand shared her expert insights to help create this 12-month\n            wedding-planning checklist and timeline to help brides plan a\n            stress-free path to <strong>“I do!”</strong>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"subtext\">\n            <h2>Determine Your budget</h2>\n            <p>\n              It's time to do the math and crunch some not-so-fun numbers.\n              Before you can start anything, you have to figure out who's paying\n              for what and determine your wedding's bottom line. From there,\n              you'll want to break down said budget—what's a priority? What's\n              not?—and start allocating funds accordingly. (A little market\n              research here comes in handy.) And since these numbers will change\n              as you plan, it's smart to start a detailed spreadsheet from the\n              get-go. This will help you keep track of your spending and make it\n              easy to adjust numbers along the way.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"subtext\">\n            <h2>Make a Guest List</h2>\n            <p>\n              If only you could invite any and everyone, right? Chances are, you\n              can't, which is why you have to put a cap on dishing out invites.\n              When deciding your head count, consider your budget (how much can\n              you afford?) and your venue (how many people does it fit?). Also,\n              who's paying for what? From there, figure out how you're going to\n              divvy up the list. If you and your partner are footing the bill,\n              assume you'll get 70 percent of the invites, while both sets of\n              parents will split the other 30. But if mom and dad are\n              contributing, it's protocol to give all involved parties—your\n              parents, your partner's parents, you as a couple—one third each.\n              Next comes cutting, negotiating, and cutting some more until you\n              reach a final number.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"subtext\">\n            <h2>Select the Venue</h2>\n            <p>\n              Okay, you know who you're marrying.
